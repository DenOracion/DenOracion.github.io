                <li>District system introduces new ways to contain buildings, such as the campus district which now holds the scientific buildings, allowing for more sprawled out empires.</li>
                <li>Revamped Civics: A new civic tree, copying the technology tree has been implemented alongside a new government system, replacing ideologies from 5. Each civic unlocks new policy cards that will each provide unique bonuses when placed inside the government. Different governments will also give different bonuses and hold different types of government cards.</li>
                <li>Builders: Workers are now builders, units that can complete improvements instantly but use charges instead. These builders can build, repair or remove improvements on tiles while also being able to harvest features or resources to give a one time boost to the city the tile belongs to, but it will remove the resource or feature from the map.</li>
                <li>City States: City States now play a more crucial part, with the envoy system, fight other civilizations for suzerainty over these city states and reap the benefits with stat boosts for every 3, 6, and 9 envoys players send and each city state having a unique suzerain bonus for the civilization with the most envoys inside the city state.</li>
                <li>Reworked Happiness Mechanic: Civilization 6 removes the happiness mechanic and in its place, the amenities mechanic to manage empire happiness and push players towards a more expansionist playstyle.</li>
